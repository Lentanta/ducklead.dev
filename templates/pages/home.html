          ðŸ’¾ A Little About Myself
        </h2>
        <p class="text-[#895102] text-lg mt-1">
          Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer who <b>loves building silly things</b> and exploring everything related to
          software
          and computer science. I also enjoy drawing, creating pixel art, making video games, and learning about
          graphics
          programming.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[#895102] text-lg mt-1">
          With years of experience working in the ever-evolving JavaScript ecosystem, Iâ€™ve crafted smooth user
          interfaces
          with Next.js, and built reliable backends with Node.js. I enjoy solving real-world problems with
          elegant code, thrive in fast-paced environments, and love turning ideas into working products that people
          actually enjoy using.

          ðŸ¦† Why The Duck Lead?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-[#895102] text-lg mt-1">
          I think everyone has their own goals,some want to become a CTO, others aim to be a tech lead. But for me, the
          highest position I aspire to is becoming a duck owner.
        </p>
        <p class="text-[#895102] text-lg mt-1">Own a farm. Lead a flock of ducks. Thatâ€™s the dream!</p>

          ðŸ’» Why Go and HTMX?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-[#895102] text-lg mt-1">
          Iâ€™ve built my own websites using the JavaScript tech stack before, but the constant changes and complexity of
          the JS ecosystem made me look for something simpler and more stable. I wanted a stack thatâ€™s fast,
          straightforward, and enjoyable to work with.
        </p>
        <p class="text-[#895102] text-lg mt-1">Thatâ€™s why I chose Go. Pairing it with HTMX lets me keep things minimal
          while still building dynamic, responsive web apps without the heavy frontend overhead.</p>
