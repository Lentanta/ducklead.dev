As a developer, continuous learning and self-improvement are essential. This list explores books that have significantly impacted my journey, both in coding skills and overall well-being. Whether you're a coding novice or a seasoned developer, I believe these reads offer valuable insights

## Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

Written by ***Gerald Jay Sussman, Hal Abelson, and Julie Sussman***

Huge thanks to my friend [Khoa Huỳnh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khoahuynhdev) for introducing me to this legendary text during our university days.

This book, also known as SICP or the Wizard Book, ignited my passion for functional programming. It’s a challenging textbook used at MIT that requires solid math skills, but I believe it can be rewarding for anyone interested in becoming a better programmer or software engineer.

If you’re up for the challenge, I recommend reading the Lisp version and supplementing it with the MIT 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Spring 1986) lectures.

## Meditations

Written by ***Marcus Aurelius***

Thank you my friend [Cameron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-chardukian/) for for opening my eyes to Stoicism through this book.

Life can be incredibly difficult, but Stoicism teaches us a valuable lesson: focus on what you can control. You may not be able to choose what life throws your way, but you can choose your response. Even when faced with challenging circumstances, it's possible to enjoy life and find happiness.

As Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor himself wrote, *"When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love...".*

## The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development

Written by ***Chad Fowler***

In my opinion, becoming a programmer shouldn't be driven by the desire for wealth or fame. True enjoyment comes from passion! Passion, I believe, is one of the most crucial aspects for success and fulfilment as a programmer or software engineer.

## The Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO

Written by ***Robin Sharma***

While I don't often read self-help books, it's not because I dislike them. Instead, I find that many offer perspectives on life that I already agree with and enjoy.

This particular book, however, stood out. It taught me valuable lessons about love, authentic interactions, and savouring life's experiences. It's like a new lens that's helped me see the world in a fresh, enriching way.
